# Function Generator PCB Project

Welcome to the Function Generator PCB Project repository! This project includes the design and layout of a function generator PCB, along with all necessary files and schematics.

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a function generator circuit on a PCB. The function generator can produce different types of waveforms, including sine, square, and triangle waves, at various frequencies.

## Repository Contents
